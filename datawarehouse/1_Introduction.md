# Introduction
Data is nothing but raw and unprocessed facts and statistics stored or free-flowing over a network. Data
becomes information when it is processed, turning it into something meaningful. Collecting and storing data for analysis is a
human activity and we have been doing it for thousands of years. In order to effectively work with huge amounts of data in an
organized and efficient manner, databases were invented.
```
A Database is a collection of related data/information:
organized in a way that data can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.
captures information about an organization or organizational process
supports the enterprise by continually updating the database

Database examples:-
Relational databases: Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL
Document databases:   MongoDB and CouchDB
Key-value databases:  Redis and DynamoDB
Wide-column stores:   Cassandra and HBase
Graph databases:      Neo4j and Amazon Neptune
```
In database management, there are two main types of databases: operational databases and analytical databases.
Operational databases are primarily used in online transactional processing (OLTP) scenarios, where there is a need to
collect, modify, and maintain data daily. This type of database stores dynamic data that changes constantly, reflecting up-tothe-
minute information.

On the other hand, analytical databases are used in online analytical processing (OLAP) scenarios to store and track
historical and time-dependent data. They are valuable for tracking trends, analyzing statistical data over time, and making
business projections. Analytical databases store static data that is rarely modified, reflecting a point-in-time snapshot.
Although analytical databases often use data from operational databases as their main source, they serve specific data
processing needs and require different design methodologies.
